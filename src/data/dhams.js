        history: `Mukam is the most sacred site for the Bishnoi community. It is here that Guru Jambheshwar Ji took Samadhi in 1536 AD. Before leaving his mortal body at Lalasar, he instructed his disciples to bury his body at this specific spot in the village of Talwa (now Mukam).

He chose burial over cremation to send a final powerful message: protecting trees is more important than rituals. By not burning wood for a pyre, he saved trees even in death.

A magnificent temple now stands here, built over his Samadhi. Twice a year, during the Amavasya of Falgun and Ashvin, a massive fair is held where lakhs of devotees come to pay homage and participate in the 'Pahul' ceremony.`,
        miracle: "It is said that anyone who performs 'Shramdaan' (labor service) here finds peace and their wishes are fulfilled.",

He lived here simply, surviving on little water and food, radiating spiritual energy. This is the place where the 'Pahul' (sacret water) was first created. The Khejri trees on this dune are ancient and considered witnesses to the birth of the sect.`,
        miracle: "Despite being a high sand dune in a desert, the trees here remain eternally green, blessed by the Guru.",
